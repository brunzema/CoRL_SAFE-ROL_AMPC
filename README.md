# Paper for the CoRL 2024 Workshop SAFE-ROL

In this repo, we uploaded the final workshop paper __Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization__.
Also, check out our video of the hardware experiments [here](https://youtu.be/R96QpD5iusI). We will delete this repo after CoRL 2024.
